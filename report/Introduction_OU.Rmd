## Introduction 

### Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process 
The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is a stochastic Gaussian process with continuous paths. The following is the stochastic differential equation: $
\begin{equation} \label{eq:1} dX_t = \gamma (\mu â€“ X_t) dt + \sigma dW_t \end{equation}$  [Reference]
Where $W_t$ is a standard Brownian motion on $t \in (0, \infty),\gamma > 0, \sigma > 0$
The interpretation of $\gamma$ is the rate of mean reversion. Mean reversion is one of the properties that Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process holds. This property allows that the distance will eventually revert to the long-run average [reference].The rate indicates how strong the distance will react to perturbations. $\theta$ is the asymptotic mean. $\sigma$ is the parameter showing the volatility. 

The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process assumes that the photons exchanged at different time are independent of each other. 

One of the benefits of using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is that it has explicit formulation including both the stochastic differential equation and solution of its own stochastic differential function which is  
 $\begin{equation} \label{eq:2} X_t = x_0e^{-\gamma t} + \sigma \int_{0}^{t} e^{\gamma (t-s)} dB_s \end{equation} $
One of the downsides of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is that a very small amount of variation such as measurement error can profoundly affect the performance of the model. 
Also the distance is always positive. However, the donor acceptor in Ornstein-Uhlenbeck allows negative distance.
